# Download the file DecisionTreen ML7pynb and use it in the following task.

In the end of the template, a new dataset is provided. Use the generated decision tree d as given in the template (do not change the tree d itself,
treat it as read-only) to classify the samples of the new dataset. Decide for each sample in the new dataset, whether rain or no-rain is predicted following the split rules from tree d. 

For this task, write your code within a user defined function predict_rains() that takes the required input parameters

Display the classification result in in your code.

Also, include the answer to the following question in the file.

Explain the decision tree data structure stored in the variable d. Which python data types are used in which combination?

Upload the completed program 1.
