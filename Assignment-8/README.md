Download the files train.csv and test.csv and write the code to estimate the linear regression coefficients of the training data. Use the model to predict the test data and 
evaluate the model performance by using RMSE(root mean square as the metric) 

Please upload your code here. Points will not be given if you donot upload your code and also make sure to print the output in the notebook cell while uploading.

As a preprocessing step, delete the rows that contain NaN values
