# Programming: Question 1

Please download the fie iris.csv and perform the following tasks

1. Create a user-defined function to compute pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients. The function takes two variables as arguments and returns the 
   coefficient between them. <br/>
   
2. plot the graphs to visualize the correlation between two variables and also write a code to visualize the correlation matrix. <br/>

3. Perform z-score standardization on the data.  <br/>

4. Compute covariance matrix for the standardized data points. <br/>

5. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the covariance matrix and print them descending order <br/>

<b> Note:

Please upload your solution as one pynt file. If the code has any syntactical, logic errors, and/or exceptions it will not be accepted.
