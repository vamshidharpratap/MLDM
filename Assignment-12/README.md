Implement a class that contains the following methods: <br/>
A constructor that takes two parameters: a list of the predicted classes, and a list of the ground truth.<br/>

• **"getPrecision":** a function that returns the precision of the given predicted and ground truth lists. <br/>
• **"getRecall":** a function that returns the recall of the given predicted and ground truth lists. <br/>
• **"getPrecision":** a function that returns the precision of the given predicted and ground truth lists. <br/>
• **"getAccuracy":** a function that returns the accuracy of the given predicted and ground truth lists. <br/>
• **"getF1Score":** a function that returns the F1-score of the given predicted and ground truth lists. <br/>
• **"printEvaluation":** a function that visualizes all the evaluation metrics calculated in a form of a table. <br/>
